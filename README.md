# WOW-Mount-Probability-Tracker
 A lil' Python project that keeps track of how many times you attempted to roll for a mount, and calculates how unlucky you would have to be to not get it after "x" number of tries

The first release version has the mounts from past expansions (up to Battle for Azeroth) obtainable from world bosses, dungeons, and raids.
